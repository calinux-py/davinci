# Okay DaVinci
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
This script is a voice-based personal assistant powered by OpenAI's ChatGPT. It listens for a trigger phrase ("Okay DaVinci"), transcribes the user's speech input, generates a response using ChatGPT, and converts the response into speech using the Elevenlabs text-to-speech module. The assistant engages in a conversation with the user, asking for satisfaction with the response and generating a new response if necessary. The script also includes logging functionality and API key handling.

-Once the script is running, it will be in a listening state, waiting for a trigger phrase. 
-The default trigger phrase is "Okay DaVinci." You can modify this phrase as per your preference.

-When you want to interact with the personal assistant, say the trigger phrase followed by your command or query. 
-For example, say "Okay DaVinci", patiently await DaVinci's response before posing your question, such as "What's the capital of Montana?"

-The personal assistant will respond to your input with a concise answer within 30 words, while maintaining proper language etiquette.

-After receiving the response, the personal assistant will ask if it's acceptable by saying phrases like "Is this satisfactory?" or "Is this sufficient?" You can respond with "yes" or "no."

-If you respond with "yes," the conversation ends. If you respond with "no," the personal assistant will retry generating a response based on your previous input.

-You can exit the conversation at any time by saying keywords like "nevermind," "exit," or "quit."


Note: Make sure you have a working microphone connected to your device for voice input, and ensure that your surroundings are relatively quiet for accurate speech recognition.
